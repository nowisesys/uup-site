        This is the test page for rendering simple views.
-->

<h1>Routed view</h1>
<p>
    This is similar to the <a href="../../view">example view</a> except that in
    this example, the view is rendered by the router instead of having direct
    rendering handled by a script.

<h4>Context</h4>
<p>
    Standard context files like <a href="standard.menu">standard.menu</a> and 
    <a href="publish.inc">publish.inc</a> can be used and works the same as
    for standard page classes (OOP).
